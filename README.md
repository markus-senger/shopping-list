# shopping-list
A Unity-developed shopping list app with Firebase integration, designed for household use, allowing family members to share a simple grocery list across devices.

Of course, building the app with Unity was an overkill.

_Please note that this repository __does not include__ sensitive files like google-service.json for the Google Firebase database. For security and privacy reasons, such sensitive configuration files are deliberately omitted from this repository. To use this codebase, you'll need to create your own Firebase database._
